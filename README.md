# Draw the Blinds
### A ludum dare game

Navigate through a deadly greenhouse full of vicious plants by controlling which plants get light and which ones wither.

## Setup

2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (these days, Node comes with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org)) and PhantomJS.

3. Install [broccoli](http://gulpjs.com) and [bower](http://bower.io). Broccoli is the build system. Bower is a package manager for front-end libraries.

        npm install -g broccoli bower

4. Install the rest of the prerequisites:
  *Note: you might need to be root to install Ruby gems on your system*

        npm install
        bower install
        bundle install

5. Run the development server and unit tests:

        broccoli serve


## Deployment

I'll work something out with AWS or something at the last minute, probably.
